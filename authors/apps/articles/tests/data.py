        into colorful, rainbow letters of love to express my feelings for you.\
        But I figured I'd write the longest book in history. So, I thought\
        to show off my love for you, then, I imagined, I'll have to bring\
        the world at your feet. I longed to let the whole world know that\
        you are mine, it quickly occurred to me that more than a little\
        of men would gaze in envy. So, I resolved to simply telling\
        you that, I love you and showing you how much I care for\
        the rest of my life.  where the waters of love\
        surrounds our home, where the green grasses\
        of prosperity swerves in awe of our love. I'm not afraid\
        of the terror at night because you're the light in\
        which the sun draws her strength. I'm not afraid\
        to love you because forever is just a start with you."
